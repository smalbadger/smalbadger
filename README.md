### Hi, I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹

By day, I'm an engineer at General Dynamics Mission Systems where I work on satellite encryption. By night, I'm an automation enthusiast focused on building my software startup's product called **Facile**.

I like working on big projects - ya know, something that I can get my hands dirty with and work on for years. Last year, I started [Facade Technologies Inc.](https://github.com/facade-technologies-inc) where we do our best to make GUI automation software. We'll be releasing the alpha version of our product soon, so be sure you don't miss out by signing up [HERE!](https://facade-technologies.com/)
